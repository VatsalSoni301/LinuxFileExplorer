							FileExplorer Project
							

						        My Assumptions


						Please take care of the following things.


1 :- To run the project use "./main" (without double quote) command.


2 :- Terminal's height can be anything but width should be as wide as to accomodate all the content which is
	 being displayed on the Terminal. 


3 :- For files/directories which contain space in name backslash(/) is used as delimeter. 
     For example :- If file name is "abc def" (without double quote) then user should enter
     "abc\ def" (without double quote).


4 :- For opening file i have used xdg-open command but some files for which os does not have default 
     application at that time error shown in terminal.
     For example :- Object files(.O)
