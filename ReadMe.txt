							FileExplorer Project
							

						        My Assumptions


						Please take care of the following things.


1 :- To run the project use "./main" (without double quote) command.


2 :- Terminal's height can be anything but width should be as wide as to accomodate all the content which is
	 being displayed on the Terminal.(Full size would be prefferable)


3 :- For files/directories which contain space in name backslash(/) is used as delimeter. 
     For example :- If file name is "abc def" (without double quote) then user should enter
     "abc\ def" (without double quote).


4 :- In command mode backspace key is used to erase text and up/down/left/right/ESC to go to normal mode.


5 :- If some files are there for which os does not have any default application then such type of file will
	 not open and also will not generate any output/error.
	 For example - Object files(.o).
