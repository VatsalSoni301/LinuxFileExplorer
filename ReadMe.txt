   - press ESC key to go back to normal mode from command mode. 
   - press q key from normal mode to exit project.


2 :- For files/directories which contain space in name, backslash(/) is used as delimeter. 
     For example :- If file name is "abc def" (without double quote) then user should enter
     "abc\ def" (without double quote).


3 :- Terminal's height can be anything but width should be as wide as to accomodate all the content which is
	 being displayed on the Terminal.(Full size would be prefferable).

     
4 :- Search scrolling is not working.


5 :- In command mode backspace key is used to erase text and up/down/left/right/ESC to go to normal mode.
